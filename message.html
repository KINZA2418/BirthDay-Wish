    <h1>💌 A Special Message</h1>
    <p>
      My dearest  Kamal Ahmad Khan,  
      <br><br>
      From the moment we first met on 16 January 2024, my life has never been the same. That day still feels like magic, and every moment since has been a beautiful chapter in our story.  
      <br><br>
      You are my safe place, my happiness, and my greatest blessing. Strong yet gentle, wise yet warm — you inspire me in ways words can barely hold.  
      <br><br>
      Today, on your special day, I just want to remind you: you are deeply loved, not only as the incredible man you are, but as my Basheera — my forever.  
      <br><br>
      Happy Birthday, 🎂❤️  
    </p>
